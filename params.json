When launching this instance the user should specify the following parameters:\r\n- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID  - your aws access key needed to query aws about runnign instances and discover slaves\r\n- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - your aws secret key needed to query aws about runnign instances and discover slaves\r\n- AWS_DEFAULT_REGION - the region in which to look for slaves\r\n- REVOKE_KEYS - wether to revoke the key after the slave discovery (useful for many security reasons)\r\n\r\nAn example of the parameters required for the configuration is: \r\n    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=498o37f08b9f2vjv0982\r\n    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=n97375hf28047bv84075gfb128b8b7c21857b\r\n    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-1\r\n    REVOKE_KEYS=No\r\n\r\n## Services\r\nInstaCluster delegaes to Ambari the provisionign of services, for this reason all of the services supported by Ambari can be used, for a complete list of the servicese supported by Ambari please refer to the [official documentation](https://ambari.apache.org/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
